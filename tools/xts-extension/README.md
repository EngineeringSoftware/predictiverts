This is a Maven extension to run Ekstazi without changing the project's pom.xml
Steps:

1. mvn package
2. cp target/ekstazi-extension-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar ${MAVEN_HOME}/lib/ext

That's it!

Once you do that you can just `cd` into the project you want to run Ekstazi on and run `mvn ekstazi:ekstazi` as usual.

The only downside is that you need to `rm ${MAVEN_HOME}/lib/ext/ekstazi-extension-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` if you donâ€™t want to run Ekstazi. What I usually do is to put the extension in a local maven installation and then switch between installations by setting the $MAVEN_HOME variable appropriately.
